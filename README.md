## Overview

This challenge involves the creation of a card component that allows users to view the optimal layout depending on their screen size. 
This is my first challenge completed from the Frontend Mentor platform.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code editor
- Responsive Web Design (RWD) (Grid view & Media queries)

### What I learned

This challenge prompted me to find out more about responsive web design and the mobile-first approach. To accomplish this design, I also had to learn a part which seemed a bit strange which is working with the "filter" property of images ("img") to change various parameters. 

### Continued development

I still believe that there are a few things that could be looked at even though this is a fairly simple design. For example, the padding of the card component seems a bit off in mobile view, so I might look into this more. 
Another thing to mention is that I am only taking into consideration two devices so far. For example, I haven't optimised the solution for a tablet view.

This design from Frontend Mentor looks really good and I am sure that I can apply what I've learnt here to build my own customised card components in the future.


## Author

I am familiar with HTML, CSS (and a little bit of SCSS, but haven't actually used it in a project yet), JS and a bit of Node.js (I've created a simple web app before). I really want to improve my front-end skills which is why I want to start completing challenges on this platform.

To complete this solution I made use of W3schools' "Responsive Web Design - Introduction" at https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp
